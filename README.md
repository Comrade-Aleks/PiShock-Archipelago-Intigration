This is a program to be able to use PiShock (https://pishock.com) with the Archipelago Randomizer (https://archipelago.gg)
To set it up, use any text edditor (notebook for an example(though easier with vs code)) to open the .yml/yamel file, then just follow the comments there, change the "null" or examples with your values and, and it should work.
you can add as many devices or triggers(traps, items, deathlink) as you want, though i have not tested it out more than on two devices with two itemchecks (but theoretically it should work)

if you have any questions, feel free to open an Issue, or ping me and ask within the modpage of either the archipelago randomizer discord server or the pishock discord server. ill answer as fast as i can!
