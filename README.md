This is a program to be able to use PiShock (https://pishock.com) with the Archipelago Randomizer (https://archipelago.gg)
I dont know 100% how well this works as i dont own my own PiShock shockers, but it should work.
To set it up, use any text edditor (notebook for an example) to open the .env file, then just follow the comments there, change the "None" or examples with your values and such, and it should work.
you can add as many shockers or triggers as possible i believe, though i have not tested it out more than on two triggers and two shockers (but theoretically it should work)

if you have any questions, feel free to open an Issue, ill answer as fast as i can.
